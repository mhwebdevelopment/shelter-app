# Shelter App — Simple Animal Shelter Management Website

A basic and responsive web app for managing an animal shelter. Built with Next.js and powered by Sanity CMS for content management, the platform supports viewing available animals, downloading adoption applications, FAQs, and accepting donations via GoFundme. It raised over $2,000 for my local animal shelter through the implementation of multiple donation CTAs where people see the animals.
